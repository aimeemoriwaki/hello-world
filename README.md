# hello-world
introduction to Aimee


Hello, I'm joining GitHub as I transistion to a full-time data science career.

My formal education is in Materials Science (BS & MS), where I took some programming courses (Scheme, Java, MATLAB).  I've spent my post-collage career at Intel working in various semiconductor manufacturing/testing factories.  I always enjoyed working with the large amounts of data and creating scripts and UIs (JMP/JSL) to better parse and understand the data. Thus, I've decided to pivot to full-time Data Science work!

I'm currently a student in the Data Science program at Practicum to formalize my data science education and start to build some projects and coding samples that do not contain Intel IP.  I'm most interested in using data science for engineering applications, like manufacturing and design improvements or computer vision.

Outside of my career, I enjoy traveling, baking and working on real estate side-hustles with my fiance.

I'm looking forward to exploring more of GitHub and sharing my work.
